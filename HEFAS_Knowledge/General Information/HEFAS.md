## Important Resources for Our Community
### The Rapid Response Network (RRN):
The RRN is a community defense initiative designed to protect immigrant families from deportation threats and provide support during or after an arrest or detention. They rely on volunteers to protect neighbors at risk of ICE activity. If you witness or suspect immigration enforcement in the area, you can call or text them. They’ll verify the activity, provide resources, and keep the community informed through their social media platforms.

### Free Legal Support for Community College Students
As a community college student, you have access to free legal advice and support. You can book a session with a legal representative to ask questions and receive guidance, including assistance with any immigration processes you or your family might be navigating. In some cases, they can also help your family if you’re involved as a petitioner or recipient.

## Testimonial
"My favorite thing about HEFAS is just knowing it exists, and that if I refer a student to HEFAS there will be a safe and supportive environment welcoming them! Also, the student interns are super friendly and personable; plus always down to support wider campus events." by Melecia Navarro, De Anza alum and EOPS Program Coordinator
