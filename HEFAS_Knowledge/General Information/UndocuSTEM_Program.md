HEFAS' UndocuSTEM is a new Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) program in partnership with the STEM Success Program, to support and provide resources to make STEM more accessible for undocumented students. Last year we had our first UndocuSTEM Conference which will happen every spring quarter!
