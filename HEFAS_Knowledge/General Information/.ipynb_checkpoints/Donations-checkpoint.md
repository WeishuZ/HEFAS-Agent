## How to Support?

Dear Campus Community Member,

Did you know that undocumented students...
- have three main needs of financial aid, legal aid, and mental health access?
- enrolled in 6.0 or more units pay out-of-state tuition and enrollment costs that were increased to $270/unit this Summer 2023 quarter by the FHDA BOT?
- in California earn a median hourly wage of $13/hour, compared to $19/hour for immigrant workers, and $26/hour for US citizens?
- and their families greatly benefit from HEFAS (Higher Education for AB 540 Students) services?
- need your support?

HEFAS is an institutional and educational program that provides free services, reduces financial stress, and creates a safe space for all â€“ with an emphasis on students with an undocumented, low income, or AB 540 status.

Please contribute to this amazing program that supports undocumented students through thoughtful innovative programming, free services and academic supplies, student scholarships, and rapid response activities to protect undocumented students with dignity. Again, your donation will directly fund:

Student Scholarships and Awards
Student Leadership Development and Awards
Computers and Calculators Loan Program
UndocuWelcome Orientation
UndocuSTEM
HEFAS Programing and Events
