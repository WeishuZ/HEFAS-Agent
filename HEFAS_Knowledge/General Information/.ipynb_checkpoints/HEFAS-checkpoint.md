The Rapid Response Network (RRN):The RRN is a community defense initiative designed to protect immigrant families from
                                       deportation threats and provide support during or after an arrest or detention. They
                                       rely on volunteers to protect neighbors at risk of ICE activity. If you witness or
                                       suspect immigration enforcement in the area, you can call or text them. They’ll verify
                                       the activity, provide resources, and keep the community informed through their social
                                       media platforms.

"My favorite thing about HEFAS is just knowing it exists, and that if I refer a student
                                          to HEFAS there will be a safe and supportive environment welcoming them! Also, the
                                          student interns are super friendly and personable; plus always down to support wider
                                          campus events."
