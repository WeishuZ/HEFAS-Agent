Welcome!!!!

HEFAS is a great way to participate in social justice, civic engagement, and leadership projects. We focus a lot on helping out our community in and outside of school. The best part about this opportunity to help the community is that everyone is welcome! You don’t need any previous experience or undocumented to volunteer. Our transition to online schooling hasn’t stopped us from continuing to give help and valuable opportunities. We help develop any of the necessary skills you'd be likely to use in any real-life situation and opportunity. How many hours can you dedicate to HEFAS? We’d like to get to know more about you so that we can assign you to certain projects where you can learn, excel, and most of all, have fun participating! If any of these things interest you then please fill out the application above so that you can start as soon as the following school semester starts.

If you have any questions then feel free to message the HEFAS team at: [ab540hefas@gmail.com](mailto:ab540hefas@gmail.com)

**If you want to be part of our team, make sure to submit the interest form as soon as possible during Week 1 or 2. You will be then be contacted to attend a 1 hour training orientation that will happen before week 5 and then you can begin volunteering. If you do not attend the training orientation before week 5, you will not be able to volunteer with HEFAS for that quarter.**
